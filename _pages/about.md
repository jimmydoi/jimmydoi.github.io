I am a Southern California native and graduated from [CSU Northridge](https://csun.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with a BA degree in math and minors in biology, chemistry, and Japanese. After finishing at CSUN, I drove from LA to Raleigh to attend the graduate program at [NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the [Dept. of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. While at NCSU, I completed my Master's and Ph.D. degrees in statistics. After completing the Ph.D. in July 2003, I returned to California and began work as a professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.calpoly.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at [Cal Poly San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

My research interests include categorical data analysis (more specifically, optimal confidence interval methods for discrete distributions) and statistics education. Over the last several years I have been working with educators at universities and high schools in Japan on various topics including active learning and simulation-based inference.
