I am a Southern California native and graduated from [CSU Northridge](https://csun.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with a BA degree in math and minors in biology, chemistry, and Japanese. After finishing at CSUN, I drove from LA to Raleigh to attend the graduate program at [NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the [Dept. of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. While at NCSU, I completed my Master's and Ph.D. degrees in statistics. After completing the Ph.D. in July 2003, I returned to California and began work as a professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.calpoly.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

My research interests include categorical data analysis (more specifically, optimal confidence interval methods for discrete distributions) and statistics education. Over the last several years I have been working with educators at universities and high schools in Japan on various topics including active learning and simulation-based inference.

My family and I attend [New Life Community Church](https://www.newlifepismo.com) in Pismo Beach. In the past I had the pleasure of serving as faculty advisor for [EPIC SLO](https://www.crucentraALCOast.com/epicslo), the Asian American ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ. You can find out more about my Christian background at [Meet the Prof](https://meettheprof.com/view/professors/entry/jimmy-doi).





Curious about what that stuff is? Then please drop by my office to find out!

For fun, I love playing basketball and I also enjoy mountain biking. Since the Central Coast is filled with incredible trails, it's been difficult to come up with good excuses to keep my bike at home. I also enjoy practicing the classical guitar and cooking (especially Japanese food). With these last two items, I've found my main road to progress has been through lots of practice and learning from lots of mistakes!

I think you too will find that your progress in a subject like statistics often comes after lots of practice and after making plenty of mistakes. Especially if you don't find statistics to be your favorite subject, don't make the mistake of suffering through the subject alone. Take advantage of the resources around you by talking with your classmates and/or joining study groups.

And please don't ever hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. It is perfectly okay to ask "I don't understand this topic, can you explain it once again?" or "I can't get started on this homework problem, could you give me a hint?" Keep in mind that I will not do your homework problems for you, but I would be happy to lead you in the right direction.
