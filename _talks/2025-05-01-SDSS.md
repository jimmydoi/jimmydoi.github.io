During the 2023-24 academic year, I had a one-year sabbatical leave in Japan. During this time, I gave a presentation titled "ChatGPT in Statistics & Data Science Education: Examples from US Universities." This talk was presented in Japanese.

The following is based on the English translation of the ChatGPT talks I gave at [University of Tokyo (Jan 2024)](https://jimmydoi.github.io/talks/2024-01-31-UTokyo-GPT-talk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Edogawa University (Feb 2024)](https://jimmydoi.github.io/talks/2024-02-01-Edogawa-GPT-talk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
